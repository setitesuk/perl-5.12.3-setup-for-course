=head1 NAME

MooseX::InsideOut - inside-out objects with Moose

=head1 VERSION

version 0.105

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package My::Object;

  use MooseX::InsideOut;

  # ... normal Moose functionality
  # or ...

  package My::Subclass;

  use MooseX::InsideOut;
  extends 'Some::Other::Class';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MooseX::InsideOut provides metaroles for inside-out objects.  That is, it sets
up attribute slot storage somewhere other than inside C<$self>.  This means
that you can extend non-Moose classes, whose internals you either don't want to
care about or aren't hash-based.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init_meta

Apply the instance metarole necessary for inside-out storage.

=head1 TODO

=item * dumping (for debugging purposes)
